Initial implementation of k-means is written. I tried to make it as general as possible, so that the program can take input data of any dimension and sort into any number of clusters. 

Basic idea of how it works:
assign all points to appropriate cluster according to closest centroid
while cluster membership of some point changes: update location of centroid by setting it to the mean of the cluster
repeat until cluster membership does not change for any points.

K-means algorithm is in KMeans.java and works on objects of type Point (Point.java). Have not tested yet. Next step will be to write the driver.
