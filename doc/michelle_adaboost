Did some work on the high-level AdaBoost framework in AdaBoostR.java. Wrote the functions evaluateCost and minimizeCost to take care of calculating combination coefficient of new learner. I am not sure if combination coefficient has to be reevaluated for EVERY learner in the committee on every iteration or if it is just evaluated once when a learner is added to the system.

Last week, Professor Torresani proposed the following algorithm for a WeakLearner instance:
1. Choose random subset of features St such that |St| = some constant k.
2. For each example x(i), build a quadratic basis vector phi using St.
3. Regularized least square regression to compute learning hypothesis.

The next step after completing high level AdaBoostR is to implement this as weak learners and try to generate hundreds of unique weak learners.
